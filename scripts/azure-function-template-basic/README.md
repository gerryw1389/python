### Why Function Apps?

1. Speed - Time will be reduced in half or more moving from "half serverless" (Azure Automation) to "full serverless" automation technologies.
   - It takes 30+ seconds for an Azure Automation runbook to start, it takes Function Apps a fraction of a second.

2. Support - More team members know python than powershell.

3. Scale - unlimited concurrent runs.

4. Maintenance - Azure Automation requires dedicated servers which means patching and security concerns, Function Apps are completely serverless.
