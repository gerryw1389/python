# HTTPTrigger

This Azure Function uses Python as a HTTP trigger. It will extract two layers deep json into variables and read them back to the submitter. In addition, a `helpers.py` module is imported show casing the functionality of offloading functions to a different module to keep things tidy! I plan to use this as a base template for Azure Functions.
